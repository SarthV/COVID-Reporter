# COVID-Reporter

*A  sample website to report any nearby suspected Coronavirus (COVID-19) cases to the administration.*
#### The website features a news/ information bulletin where the admin can post timely updates for everyone to see. It also features Signin/ Login page where users can register themselves so as to file the patient's information. 
#### While the frontend part of the website was mainly done in HTML, CSS, JS and Bootstarp-4, the backend development was done in Django and Postgre SQL.
*Well, here are a few screenshots of the website.*
